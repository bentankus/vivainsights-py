# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Why should I use Python for Viva Insights?

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language, especially popular in data science and analytics. Here are four key reasons why a Viva Insights analyst might choose to use Python instead of other alternatives:

1.  Python has an **extensive library ecosystem** with libraries such as pandas, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), and NetworkX for advanced applications, including building machine learning models and performing Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) graph visualizations. This enables analysts to perform specialized and in-depth analysis for specific Viva Insights use cases, such as predicting employee churn by analyzing Viva Insights metrics.
    
2.  Python is **open-source** and has **no licensing costs**, allowing analysts to leverage its powerful functionality without additional expenses.
    
3.  Python's code-oriented workflow promotes **reproducibility**. This is valuable for improving the quality of the analysis and for efficiently replicating analysis with different data samples.
    
4.  Python has a **large and active user community**, which analysts can access to support and enhance their analysis capabilities.
